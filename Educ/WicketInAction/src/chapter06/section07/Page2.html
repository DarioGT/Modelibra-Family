<h2>Page2</h2>
<p>This page was constructed during a form submission that generated a so-called <em>flash</em> message. The feedback panel below shows the message</p>
<div wicket:id="feedback"></div>
<p>Click this <a href="#"
	wicket:id="returnLink">link</a> to return to the previous page with all input
still available. Note that this does a serverside redirect, not a back
button.</p>
