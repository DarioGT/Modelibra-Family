	I am an associate professor in the Business School at the Laval University (Universit√© Laval), 
    Quebec, Canada. I received a B.Sc. in informatics from the University of Sarajevo in 1976, an M.Sc. 
    in computer science from the University of Maryland in 1982, and a Ph.D. in management information 
    systems from the University of Minnesota in 1986. My main research interests are in the spiral development 
    of dynamic web applications using Open Source Software (OSS), Java, databases, CSS, XML, design patterns 
    and frameworks. My teaching interests are in presenting spirals of my research using pedagogical patterns.
