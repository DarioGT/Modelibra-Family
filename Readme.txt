Modelibra is an open source software family of tools and frameworks to support domain-driven development in Java: a graphical tool for model design and code generation, a domain model framework, a web component framework based on Wicket for rapid development of dynamic web applications, and a GUI component framework based on Swing for rapid development of dynamic client applications. The family backbone is the domain model framework that carries the family name.

Domain Model

In computer terms, a domain model is a model of specific domain classes that describe the core data and their behavior. From an organizational perspective, a domain model is a model of the domain. Within this domain, an organization conducts its business. The memory of any organization may be represented as a domain model.

The heart of any software is a domain model. When a model is well designed and when it can be easily represented and managed in an object oriented language, a developer may focus on views of the software and they are what users care about the most.
