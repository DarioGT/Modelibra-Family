Modelibra

+ one-to-one relationships
+ inheritance relationships
+ more specific class generation from configurations
+ Java annotations to replace XML configurations
+ a log in XML about adds, removals and updates.
+ i18n at the data level: categories_fr.xml
+ full scale security at the Modelibra level with 
  groups, roles, concepts, properties, neighbors
+ B-tree data structures for entities
+ main memory index structure for faster retrievals (to be fully tested)
+ Java queries for Modelibra (similar to native queries of db4o)
+ performance benchmarks
+ JDBC persistence
+ Modelibra with Spring
+ Modelibra with Hibernate
+ how to use an existing db with Modelibra?
