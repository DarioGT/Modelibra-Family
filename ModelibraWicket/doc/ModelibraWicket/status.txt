Not to forget for deployment:

	email password must be yes and not scrambled (email-config.xml)
	    ulaval must be the last email config (email-config.xml)
	    
	login must be true (specific-domain-config.xml)
	
	remove servlet-api.jar
	
	remove development tags from web.xml.
	    (WEB-INF/server)
	
	admin password must not be scrambled in users.xml
	    (use dr, dr and change it on the web) 
	    
	rename the app name in jetty-config.xml to dmLite
	    
	src/org/domain; classes
	lib
	config

	version.txt
	
Objective

  To update to Wicket-2.0.
  
Done
  
  Lookup at any level of the hierarchy (topics and subtopics). 
		Now, you can lookup only at the root level of an entry concept.
  
  
To do
	
	Last value as default value.
	
	Table component with sort columns.
    
    Back context may be improved for add and edit by returning 
	    to the first list view context?
    
    Make a link of an absorbed entity parent.
    
    Multiple relations between the same two concepts (only one lookup now).

	Save context page by a user. Back to the user saved context page.
	
	Add a Display Parent link for parents that you do not come from?

	Type conversion error msgs?
    
    Do not display what you cannot use?
    
    Undo at least the last action (similar to Clipboard). (Redo?)
    
    Display the model config as a report.
    
    Display a tree of subjects.
	
	There is a performance hit on the display of all approved subjects (left column)?

	Generalize specific web components as much as possible.
	Introduce more display web components in dmWicket.
