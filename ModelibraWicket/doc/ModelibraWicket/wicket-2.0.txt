where before you used to do A.add(new B("id"));
you now do new B(A,"id"); 

i have just migrated wicket 2.0 from commons-logging to slf4j as was
previously discussed and agreed upon.

people using 2.0 need to add the following to their project's pom or
equivalent:

if you are using commons-logging:

<dependency>
      <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
      <artifactId>slf4j-jcl</artifactId>
     <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>


if you are using log4j

<dependency>
            <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
            <artifactId>slf4j-log4j12</artifactId>
            <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>

these jars will bind slf4j to the proper logging library

if you are using another logging impl like jdk see slf4j website for the
appropriate binding jar
